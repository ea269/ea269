# 👋 Hi, I'm Emmanuel!

I'm a recent **Computer Science** graduate from **CSULB** and a first-generation Mexican-American based in the **South Bay, CA**. 

Currently, I am pivoting my focus toward **Cybersecurity** and **Systems Administration**. I'm particularly interested in defensive (Blue Team) operations, network hardening, and virtualization. Outside of my professional life, I’m a fitness enthusiast—chasing a 275+ lbs bench press—and an avid modder of everything from handheld consoles to my mechanical keyboards, controllers, and PCs.

### Technical Focus
* **Systems Administration:** Managing a self-hosted **Proxmox VE** environment utilizing Docker and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) for home infrastructure.
* **Network Security:** Implementing DNS sinkholing via **Pi-hole** and exploring network segmentation.
* **SOC Operations:** Currently studying for the **Splunk Core Certified User** exam to build expertise in security observability.
