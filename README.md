# Hello there, I'm Emmanuel! 👋

I'm a recent **Computer Science** graduate from **CSULB** and a first-generation Mexican-American based in the **South Bay, CA**. 

Currently, I am pivoting my focus toward **Cybersecurity** and **Systems Administration**. I'm particularly interested in defensive (Blue Team) operations, network hardening, and virtualization. Outside of my professional life, I’m a fitness enthusiast chasing a 275+ lbs bench press, and an avid modder of everything from handheld consoles to my mechanical keyboards, controllers, and PCs.

### Technical Focus
* **Systems Administration:** Architecting and managing a self-hosted Proxmox VE environment. I utilize Docker, LXC, and Linux to maintain 99.9% uptime for core services and am currently deploying an Active Directory lab to master IAM and Group Policy.
